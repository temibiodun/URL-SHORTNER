A URL shortner is a web service or tool that takes a long and unwieldy Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and converts it into a shorter,
more manageable form.
The primary purpose of a URL shortener is to make long URLs more user-friendly, shareable, and easier to remember.
It’s important to note that while URL shorteners offer many benefits, they do have some drawbacks, such as potential link obfuscation (users can’t easily see where the link leads) and concerns about privacy and the longevity of short links. As a result, the use of URL shorteners has evolved, and some services offer features like link previews and the ability to set expiration dates for short links to address these issues. Regardless, a URL shortners are widely used to make it more convenient for the users to track those URLs when they are surfing the internet.

THE BASICS

Now, the requirements of our URL shortner are:

Take the URL in input and return short URL
If a short URL is given, redirect the user to the original URL
The generated short URL should contain only alphabets (a-z), (A-Z) and numbers (0–9)
If there already exists a short URL corresponding to the input long URL, return the same short URL instead of generating a new one
